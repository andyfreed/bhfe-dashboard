# Icon Setup Instructions

To complete the PWA setup, you need to add app icons to the `public` folder.

## Required Icons

1. **`icon-192x192.png`** - Standard PWA icon (192x192 pixels)
2. **`icon-512x512.png`** - Large PWA icon (512x512 pixels)
3. **`apple-icon-180x180.png`** - iOS home screen icon (180x180 pixels)

## Creating Icons

1. Create or use an existing logo/icon for your app
2. Resize the image to the required dimensions:
   - 192x192 pixels for `icon-192x192.png`
   - 512x512 pixels for `icon-512x512.png`
   - 180x180 pixels for `apple-icon-180x180.png`

3. Save the PNG files in the `public` folder with the exact names above

## Design Guidelines

- Use a simple, recognizable design
- Ensure the icon looks good at small sizes
- Use a solid background color (recommended: #3b82f6 or your brand color)
- Avoid text unless it's very minimal
- Test how it looks on both light and dark backgrounds
